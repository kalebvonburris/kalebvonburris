# Hello!

I love recreational mathematics, computer science, artificial intelligence, graphics, table top roleplaying games, and much more!

## Repositories

### School Work

I'm currently attending the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and you can see my coursework [here](https://github.com/kalebvonburris/Kalebs-College-Work).

### *Work* Work

I'm currently working for the Alaska Satellite Facility on a private repo - which will hopefully become public!

### TTRPG

I'm on hiatus, but I'm developing a TTRPG! It's called Arrata and takes influence from games like Burning Wheel, The Elder Scrolls, and Dungeons and Dragons. Arrata has a deep emphasis on providing a tight structure that emphasizes roleplaying and is as setting-agnostic as possible.

Find the repo for the game rules [here](https://github.com/kalebvonburris/Arrata-TTRPG).

In addition to the ruleset, I'm also working on a desktop application to handle character sheets [here](https://github.com/kalebvonburris/Arrata-APP).
